Module: tf.nn
Wrappers for primitive Neural Net (NN) Operations.

Description: 
operation including conv1d to conv3d and avg_pool etc.

Module: torch.nn
These are the basic building block for graphs

Description: 
functions (Loss function, Quantized function and other utility function etc) and 
layers (convolution, pooling and padding layers etc)
